        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>In this internship project, we have tried to solve
            mainly two problems that are the uniformity of aeration and
            efficiency of aeration. In the present market which is dominated
            by surface aerators, the uniformity of aeration is very less as the
            aerator is placed in a fixed position. The efficiency of surface
            aerators is very low and due to this more power is consumed
            as they need to run for a longer time. In our solution, we have
            presented a way to uniformly distribute the aerated water across
            the pond with a bottom-up approach that will lead to faster and
            uniform aeration. Our aeration system is a two-stage aeration
            system. In the first stage, the unaerated water is pumped into
            a porous media-based U-tube type aeration system where the
            water is mixed with air using the venturi principle. The second
            aeration system is a tank with a sparger-based aeration system.
            The tank is designed such that it can hold the aerated water
            for a longer period of time so that the aeration of water and
            mass transfer takes place properly. The whole system is energy
            efficient and can be run on solar power. This aeration system is
            also incorporated with automation and IoT. The aeration starts
            and stops automatically based on the sensor feedback and can
            inform the condition of the pond to the farmers through SMS
            or web interface.
